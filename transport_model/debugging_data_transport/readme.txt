Things to know:

There is clipping in the mirror (6). I boosted the semi-diameters up to 200-230. There's still a very
slight, but if you look closely noticeable clipping. 

This is permeated through lens (4) and beyond. 

sampling down to 512x512 to speed up computation. 

This data will be used to yield magnification data
