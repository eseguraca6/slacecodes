So, here's the deal:

1. your lens has a focal length of 1000 mm, but zemax says it's 515 (so, it split it in 2)
2. regardless of that, your step size is 500 mm
3. You start from 0, where the lens is, to .5f, 1f, ..., 4f 
4. So, that's it

600 nm wavelength; 1x1 mm beam; 16x16 window; 2048x2048 sampling
