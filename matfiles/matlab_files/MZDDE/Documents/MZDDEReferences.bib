	material found in two textbooks: 'Laser Beam Propagation through
	Random Media' (SPIE Volume PM53) and 'Laser Beam Scintillation with
	Applications' (SPIE Volume PM99). Topics chosen for this concise
	presentation include a review of classical Kolmogorov turbulence
	theory, Gaussian-beam waves in free space, and atmospheric effects
	on a propagating optical wave. These atmospheric effects have great
	importance in a variety of applications like imaging, free space
	optical communications, laser radar, and remote sensing. This Guide
	presents tractable mathematical models from which the practitioner
	can readily determine beam spreading, beam wander, spatial coherence
	radius (Fried's parameter), angle of arrival fluctuations, scintillation,
	aperture averaging effects, fade probabilities, bit error-rates,
	and enhanced backscatter effects, among others.},

  abstract = {This book describes a new model of the contrast sensitivity of the
	human eye based on the assumption that the contrast sensitivity is
	limited by the presence of internal noise in the visual system. First,
	a fundamental mathematical analysis of the general properties of
	the image noise is given and its effect on the perception threshold
	of the human visual system is described. The model is further developed
	for various aspects of contrast sensitivity and illustrated empirical
	data published in the technical literature. The equations needed
	for applying the model are provided. Contrast sensitivity has a significant
	influence on the perceived quality of an image, and the final chapters
	are devoted to this interaction. A model is given for the nonlinear
	behaviour of the visual system at the suprathreshold level of the
	information in normal images. A metric is given with which the perceived
	quality of the image can be calculated from the physical data given
	by the contrast sensitivity of the human eye. The effetcs of various
	parameters on image quality are discussed, and several examples are
	given in which the calculated image quality is compared with published
	measurement data.},

	in 1978. The circulation of nearly 20,000 copies is adequate testimony
	to its wide acceptance in the electro-optics and infrared communities.
	The Infrared Handbook was itself preceded by The Handbook of Military
	Infrared Technology. Since its original inception, new topics and
	technologies have emerged for which little or no reference material
	exists. This work is intended to update and complement the current
	Infrared Handbook by revision, addition of new materials, and reformatting
	to increase its utility. Of necessity, some material from the current
	book was reproduced as is, having been adjudged as being current
	and adequate. The 45 chapters represent most subject areas of current
	activity in the military, aerospace, and civilian communities and
	contain material that has rarely appeared so extensively in the open
	literature. Because the contents are in part derivatives of advanced
	military technology, it seemed reasonable to categorize those chapters

	the annual Infrared Information Symposia (IRIS), a Department of

	Analysis Center of the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan

  edition = {7th},
  abstract = {Principles of Optics is one of the classic science books of the twentieth
	century, and probably the most influential book in optics published
	in the past 40 years. The new edition is the first ever thoroughly
	revised and expanded edition of this standard text. Among the new
	material, much of which is not available in any other optics text,
	is a section on the CAT scan (computerized axial tomography), which
	has revolutionized medical diagnostics. The book also includes a
	new chapter on scattering from inhomogeneous media which provides
	a comprehensive treatment of the theory of scattering of scalar as
	well as of electromagnetic waves, including the Born series and the
	Rytov series. The chapter also presents an account of the principles
	of diffraction tomography - a refinement of the CAT scan - to which
	Emil Wolf, one of the authors, has made a basic contribution by formulating
	in 1969 what is generally regarded to be the basic theorem in this
	field. The chapter also includes an account of scattering from periodic
	potentials and its connection to the classic subject of determining
	the structure of crystals from X-ray diffraction experiments, including
	accounts of von Laue equations, Bragg’s law, the Ewald sphere of
	reflection and the Ewald limiting sphere, both generalized to continuous
	media. These topics, although originally introduced in connection
	with the theory of X-ray diffraction by crystals, have since become
	of considerable relevance to optics, for example in connection with
	deep holograms. Other new topics covered in this new edition include
	interference with broad-band light, which introduces the reader to
	an important phenomenon discovered relatively recently by Emil Wolf,
	namely the generation of shifts of spectral lines and other modifications
	of spectra of radiated fields due to the state of coherence of a
	source. There is also a section on the so-called Rayleigh-Sommerfield
	diffraction theory which, in recent times, has been finding increasing
	popularity among optical scientists. There are also several new appendices,
	including one on energy conservation in scalar wavefields, which
	is seldom discussed in books on optics. The new edition of this standard
	reference will continue to be invaluable to advanced undergraduates,
	graduate students and researchers working in most areas of optics.},

  author = {Doyle, K.B. and Genberg, V.L. and Michels, G.J.},
  volume = {TT58},
  series = {Tutorial Texts in Optical Engineering},
  edition = {First},
  abstract = {In the development of an optical instrument, the optical system error
	budget underscores the multidisciplinary aspect of the design effort.
	At the top level, an optical performance goal is specified and a
	systematic allocation of acceptable errors is typically divided between
	the design, fabrication, and alignment of the optics along with environmental
	effects. Environmental effects may be further divided between thermal
	and structural effects. The ability to determine the thermal and
	structural effects on the system are therefore fundamental in the
	design process and critical in the evaluation of design trades during
	the development of an optical instrument. The emphasis of this tutorial
	is to present optomechanical modeling techniques to effectively design
	and analyze high-performance optical systems. The first goal is to
	discuss thermal and structural modeling methods using finite element
	analysis to predict the integrity and performance of optical elements
	and optical support structures. The second goal addresses the process
	of integrating thermal and structural responses into optical design
	software packages. Such integrated techniques allow the numerical
	simulation of optical system performance while including the multidisciplinary
	aspects of the design process. This leads to shorter design cycles,
	optimized designs, and models that accurately predict hardware behavior.
	An example of a detailed finite-element model and the corresponding
	hardware is shown below for NASA's Earth Observer-1, which was successfully
	launched in November 2000. The first two chapters provide a review
	and act as reference material for the rest of the chapters in the
	text. The first chapter provides a review of mechanical engineering
	and finite element theory. Included in this section are the equations
	of elasticity, fracture mechanics, failure theories, heat transfer,
	structural dynamics, and a discussion on finite-element modeling
	issues. The second chapter discusses optical fundamentals and performance
	metrics including polarization, image quality, and image formation.
	In addition, the use of Zernike polynomials and Legendre-Fourier
	polynomials are introduced to represent optical surface data. Chapter
	3 discusses finite-element model construction and analysis methods
	for predicting displacements of optical components and support structures.
	Topics include modeling methods for optical components, adhesive
	bond models, surface coating effects, flexure mounts, test supports,
	and assembly processes. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss methods to integrate
	structural and thermal response quantities into the optical model
	and the effect they have on optical performance. Chapter 4 details
	how to represent optical element rigid-body motions and the use of
	interferogram files to represent optical surface deformations in
	the optical model. Also discussed are methods to predict line-of-sight
	error using finite- element analysis and design equations to minimize
	the effect of mechanical obscurations on image quality. Chapter 5
	discusses thermoelastic and thermo-optic modeling techniques. Also
	included in this chapter are modeling techniques to account for bulk
	volumetric absorption, mapping temperatures from the thermal to structural
	model, and methods to account for moisture and adhesive curing. Chapter
	6 provides an introduction to the analysis of adaptive optics. Concepts
	and definitions including correctability and influence functions
	are discussed. Also, the mathematics to compute actuator inputs to
	minimize optical surface deformations are presented along with examples.
	Chapter 7 discusses structural optimization theory and applications,
	including the use of optical responses as constraints in structural
	optimization models. An application of multidisciplinary optimization
	is reviewed. In Chapter 8, a simple telescope serves as an example
	for many of the analysis techniques discussed in earlier chapters.
	Model files and results files are included on a CD so that readers
	can review specific details of input and output and even run the
	example cases as desired. In Chapter 9, an integrated optomechanical
	analysis example is presented for a lens assembly with laser loading.
	Thermal, structural, and optical analyses are performed to compute
	the change in focus, wavefront error, point spread function, and
	modulation transfer function as a function of laser power. Numerical
	simulation plays an integral role in the development of a successful
	hardware program. The goals of this tutorial are to present optomechanical
	modeling and integrating techniques to develop multidisciplinary
	models to effectively design and analyze high-performance optical
	systems. Ultimately, these techniques may be employed to perform
	detailed design trades, minimize schedule and cost, and maximize
	optical performance.},

	L(W)WKD and in earlier versions of the French model, PIRAM. The first
	part of the report discusses changes to the basic scaling equations
	that are used in the L(W)WKD model, and the iterative method used
	by DREV. It also discusses changes to the equations that relate the
	parameters produced by the basic scaling equations to meteorologically
	important parameters, and to the model used to calculate the refractive
	index profiles from the visible to the far infrared. The second part
	describes the additions and changes to the program's modes of operation,
	its new options, outputs, and compilation modes. The third part of
	the report presents some typical examples of the results obtainable
	using the program. Finally, some conclusions and future improvement

	the image quality of optical telescopes; however, these effects vary
	drastically with the chosen image-quality criterion. Rigorous analytical
	calculations of these diffraction effects are often unwieldy, and
	virtually all commercially available optical design and analysis
	codes that have a diffraction-analysis capability are based on numerical
	Fouriertransform algorithms that frequently lack an adequate sampling
	density to model narrow spiders. The effects of spider diffraction
	on the Strehl ratio 1or peak intensity of the diffraction image2,
	full width at half-maximum of the point-spread function, the fractional
	encircled energy, and the modulation transfer function are discussed
	in detail. A simple empirical equation is developed that permits
	accurate engineering calculations of fractional encircled energy
	for an arbitrary obscuration ratio and spider configuration. Performance
	predictions are presented parametrically in an attempt to provide
	insight into this sometimes subtle phenomenon.},

	theory and results of optics are presented early on in the book,
	along with a discussion of optical materials. Aberrations, and their
	correction, and image analysis are then covered in great detail.
	Subsequent chapters deal with design optimisation and tolerance analysis.
	Several design examples are then given, beginning with basic lens
	design forms, and progressing to advanced systems, such as gradient
	index and diffractive optical components. In covering all aspects
	of optical design, including the use of modern lens design software,
	this book will be invaluable to students of optical engineering as
	well as to anyone engaged in optical design at any stage.},

	activity in the military, aerospace, and civilian communities and
